# 20.02 Standard operating principles

## Process

The process is illustrated [here](../../20-research/)

## Principles

- Use [Markdown](../../10-lab/10_processes/10.07.markdown.html) for manuscripts, presentations, and knowledge management
- Use Git to version, collaborate, and share

The principles are reflected in the [paper template](20.20.paper-templates.html), the [presentation template](20.28.presentation.html), and the [thesis template](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/thesis-template){: target="_blank"}.

## Project management

Notes on project management are added to the README.md file of the repository.
Expected contributions can be specified using [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/){: target="_blank"}.
