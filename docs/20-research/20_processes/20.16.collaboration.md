Changes are tracked by the collaborative versioning system git.
Tutorials on git are available online ([1](https://learngitbranching.js.org/){: target="_blank"}, [2](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron){: target="_blank"}).

**Contributing changes**

- Check the git-diff (gitk) before committing changes.
- Use the following commit message format (do not start commit message with #3):

```shell
git commit -m 'address limitations [iss28]'
```

- Commit minor changes directly to the `polishing` branch, use dedicated branches otherwise (especially when changes need to be discussed in a pull-request).
- Create a single branch for issues that are related (e.g., group all issues referring to the introduction in the branch `update_introduction`).
- Example:

```shell
git switch main
git checkout -b iss12
```

- While working locally on the iss12, rebase it on main when the main branch has been updated by coauthors (for better management of the history):

```shell
git switch iss12
git rebase main
```

- Once the branch is ready for review, revisions, and merging, share it:

```shell
git push iss12
# set the upstream branch as suggested
```

- Do not rebase shared branches while working on it.
- Discuss, revise and merge on shared branches (github.com).
- Merge when changes have been confirmed:

```shell
git switch main
git merge --squash iss12
git push
```

**Retrieving changes from coauthors**

- Check out remote branch:

```shell
git switch -c iss12 --track origin/iss12
```

- When your repository has local changes (commits): pull-rebase to avoid unnecessary merge commits:

```shell
git pull --rebase
```

- When your repository has local changes (uncommitted): stash and pull-rebase:

```shell
git stash
git pull --rebase
git stash apply
```

## Git-based collaboration with Word users

{: .highlight }
Whenever possible, **ask active coauthors to modify the paper.md file**.

Otherwise:

- To share: create a commit with the latest changes.
- Export paper as word file.
- Filename: increment the version number with every docx file that is shared externally (example: `Manuscript_v11.docx`).
- For you own reference, you may store the same file in a local directory, including the hash-id of the latest commit as the second part of the filename  (example: `Manuscript_v11 d091j209fs8.docx`).
This can be useful to track the mapping between version numbers and the corresponding hash-id (git history).

- When receiving feedback in the docx: always make sure that feedback (including tracked and untracked changes) is transferred to the paper manually.
  - Create PDF from word with tracked changes (it is important to know which ones have/have not been addressed rather than having a Word-file in which all changes have been accepted/issues addressed - this is done in the paper.md.).
  - While addressing the comments: highlight suggestions that have been addressed in green (strike out suggestions that will not be addressed), and possibly provide comments on how issues have been addressed (why this way?).
  - Typos and very minor comments: address in one commit (e.g., "fix spelling errors")
  - Other comments: address in individual commits (possibly including the comment-ids generated by the word-to-pdf export in the commit message)
  - Major issues: include in the readme.md (possibly discuss with coauthors) and address in a separate branch

## Word-based collaboration

Collaborating on Word documents (without Git versioning)

1. **Create Shared Cloud Folder**: Use cloud platforms like Dropbox or GoogleDocs for easy access to the latest version (or real-time collaboration).

2. **Distribute Tasks**: Assign specific sections to team members (e.g., introduction, methods, conclusion) or avoid parallel work to prevent overwriting changes.

3. **Use Track Changes**: Enable "Track Changes" for transparency in edits and feedback, and resolve comments to keep the document clean.

4. **Create Versions**: Save incremental versions of the document (e.g., `paper_v1.docx`, `paper_v2.docx`) to ensure progress is tracked.

5. **Decide on Reference Manager**: Choose a reference manager (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) and plugin for consistent citation formatting and easy management of references.
