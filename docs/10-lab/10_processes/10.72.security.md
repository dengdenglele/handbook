# 10.72 Security

## System and software updates

- Keep your operating system and software up-to-date, enable automatic updates
- Regularly audit and uninstall unnecessary software to reduce potential vulnerabilities
- Run antivirus software
- Turn on disk encryption
- Document your setup
- Lock the screen when you leave the room

## Backups

- Regular backups, at least weekly
- Backup on an external device
- Software: [Back-in-time](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime){: target="_blank"} (Linux) or [Kopia](https://github.com/kopia/kopia?tab=readme-ov-file){: target="_blank"}
- Share Git repositories on GitHub and with the team (publishing and distributing data across multiple devices is a useful measure against ransomware attacks)
- Test backups periodically to ensure data integrity and accessibility
- Store backups offsite or on cloud storage (encrypted) to safeguard against physical disasters
- Create a disaster recovery plan for quick restoration after data loss

## Passwords

- Use a password manager (such as [KeePass](https://keepass.info/){: target="_blank"})
- Use strong passwords
- Use different passwords for different accounts
- Educate team members on recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks targeting password theft
- Regularly change passwords, especially after suspected breaches

## Confidential data and communication

- Classify confidential data in the handbook (see [example](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/10-lab/11_hr.html){: target="_blank"})
- Do not post personal data online without consent
- Store sensitive data (such as grades) in directories with restricted access rights
- Prefer end-to-end encrypted channels
- [Sign your E-Mails](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/its/dienstleistungen/iam/zertifikate/e-mail/){: target="_blank"}
- Be aware of [phishing and social engineering attacks](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/Cyber-Sicherheitslage/Methoden-der-Cyber-Kriminalitaet/Social-Engineering/social-engineering_node.html){: target="_blank"}
- Use a shared Nextcloud directory for sharing data

## Authentication and access

- Use 2-factor authentication whenever possible
- Give access to confidential data only when needed and revoke it when it is no longer required
- For confidential data: Apply the principle of least privilege (users should have only the access necessary for their roles)

## Spam or abusive language in open GitHub repositories

- See [block or report users](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam){: target="_blank"}

## Travel

- Do not leave your equipment out of sight
- Do not log into your online accounts on other devices
- Do not use public WiFi hotspots or charging stations
- Turn off your computer and phone completely when traveling across borders and checkpoints
- Use VPN and communicate through encrypted channels
- Use privacy screens to prevent shoulder surfing when working in public spaces, do not work on confidential data when others can see your screen

## General Security Practices

- Educate team members with regular security training on the latest threats and best practices
- Use sandboxing or virtualization for testing software or opening unknown files
- Maintain a clear incident response plan for addressing breaches or malware infections
